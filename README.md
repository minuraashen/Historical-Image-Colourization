# **🌈 Intelligent Historical Image Restoration**
## Deep Learning for Colorization, Denoising & Super-Resolution with Explainability

<!-- Add a sample result image here -->

## **📌 Overview**
### **This project restores old or grayscale images by applying:**
✔ Automatic Colorization using CNN + GAN  
✔ Scratch Removal & Denoising  
✔ Super-Resolution Enhancement with ESRGAN  
✔ Explainability (Attention Heatmaps using Grad-CAM)  
✔ Web-based Deployment for user interaction  

## **✨ Features**
✅ Automatic Colorization – Converts grayscale to realistic color  
✅ Denoising & Scratch Removal – Removes noise and artifacts  
✅ Super-Resolution – Enhances image quality for sharp details  
✅ Explainable AI – Visualize attention maps for colorization decisions  
✅ Web App – Upload and restore photos instantly  
✅ Edge Optimized – Model converted to ONNX and quantized for deployment on low-power devices
